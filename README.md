Hi, Iâ€™m Charlie Austin, an Applied Mathematics and Computer Science student at Texas A&M University.

I have experience with Python through multiple college courses, and am currently learning C++.

For my classes, Github is an optional way to submit code for homework assignments and projects.  I know that Github is something I will
be using every day in my career in the future, so I wanted to take it upon myself to become familiar with it now.
